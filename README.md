## Summary

This app was built to handle one those little annoying tasks we all have to do - Meal plans and shopping lists.

At a base level create recipes using user inserted ingredients. These recipes are then used to create meal plans. Once a meal plan has been created, the app will collate all the ingredients into one shopping list. Added sections are included for household items (kitchen-roll, toothpaste etc) to create a full shopping list. There is alkos functionality to create meal plan templates to further increase efficiency.

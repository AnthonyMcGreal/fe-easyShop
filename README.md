## Welcome To The Easy Shop Front End Repository

## Summary

This app was built to provide a solution to one those little annoying tasks we
all have to do - Meal plans and shopping lists. When making a meal plan I
noticed the same few issues creeping up;

- Forgetting recipes and then struggling to think of meals to add to my meal
  plan
- Spending time reading through recipes or trying to remember recipes to write
  out a shopping list of ingredients
- Having an ordered shopping list with grouped items so I can get in and out of
  the supermarket as quickly as possible

Easy Shop fixes these issues and makes creating a meal plan and shopping list
nice, easy and quick.

In summary, the app allows users to add ingredients, users then create recipes
using the added ingredients and then these recipes are used to build a meal
plan. Finally, users create a shopping list by adding misc items that aren't
recipe related. The app will collate all the ingredients and misc items and sort
them according to storage type(ie. chilled products) to allow for a quick shop.

## Using this app

Ive decided not to release this app via the play/app store as I don't want to
worry about any GDPR issues so you will need to run Easy Shop through the expo
go app. There are 2 methods of running the app, both are outlined below.

## Using the development link

For android users the app can be run directly in the Expo Go app using the
following link : https://expo.dev/@mvpant87/EasyShop

Unfortunately this method doesn't work for iOS users

## Running the app locally

Firstly you will need to clone this repository to your machine. Please follow
the following instructions provided by GitHub Docs to do this

https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository

- To install the necessary dependencies run the following command in your
  terminal;

         npm i

- To run the application locally use the following command in your terminal;

         npm start

You can then use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code in the terminal.

## Logging in

To log in to the app, and to avoid the afore mentioned GDPR issues Ive created a
demo account. You can use the following credentials to log in;

email: demoaccount@demo.co.uk password: demoPassword

## Creating a personal account

If you like the app and would like a personal account then reach out and I can
create one that doesn't include any personal info. That way I don't break any
laws and you get to enjoy the app. Everyone wins.
